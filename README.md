# GitHub Tune üéµ

**Turn your GitHub contribution graph into a musical melody.**

GitHub Tune transforms your contribution history into music, creating a unique melody that represents your coding journey. Each contribution level generates a different note, bringing your GitHub activity to life through sound.

## üéÆ Demo

Visit [GitHubTune.com](https://githubtune.com) to try it now!

1. Enter your GitHub username
2. Watch as your contribution graph is visualized
3. Press play to hear your coding activity as music
4. Adjust speed, scale, and harmony settings to customize

### Components

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit application with Tone.js for audio synthesis
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda functions for fetching and processing GitHub data
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK for deploying and managing cloud resources

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (for deployment)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/) (for deployment)

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-tune.git
cd github-tune

# Install dependencies for all components
pnpm -r install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the frontend development server
cd frontend
pnpm run dev

# In a separate terminal, build the backend
cd backend
pnpm run build
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to AWS (requires configured AWS credentials)
cd infrastructure
pnpm run build
pnpm cdk deploy
```

## üìä Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

### üñºÔ∏è `/frontend`

SvelteKit application that provides the user interface and audio generation.

- **Key Files**:
  - `src/routes/+page.svelte`: Main application page
  - `src/components/ContributionGraph.svelte`: GitHub-style contribution visualization
  - `src/lib/audio-engine.ts`: Tone.js integration for musical generation

### ‚öôÔ∏è `/backend`

Serverless functions that fetch and process GitHub contribution data.

- **Key Files**:
  - `functions/contributionFetcher/index.ts`: Main Lambda handler
  - `functions/contributionFetcher/parseContributions.ts`: HTML parsing logic

### üèóÔ∏è `/infrastructure`

AWS CDK code for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.

- **Key Files**:
  - `lib/infrastructure-stack.ts`: Defines AWS resources and architecture

## üéº How It Works

1. **Data Fetching**: The backend scrapes GitHub's contribution graph HTML
2. **Data Processing**: Contribution levels (0-4) are extracted from the HTML
3. **Visualization**: The frontend renders a contribution graph matching GitHub's style
4. **Sonification**: Contribution levels are mapped to musical notes:
   - Level 0 (no contributions): Silent
   - Level 1-4: Increasingly higher notes on the selected scale
5. **Playback**: Notes are played sequentially, week by week, day by day
6. **Harmonization**: Optional harmonies can be added based on the melody
